# Dynamic NFT (dNFT) with Upgradable Metadata

## 📌 Project Description
This smart contract enables the creation of Dynamic NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. Each NFT is associated with metadata that can be updated over time by its owner, enabling applications like evolving game characters, badges, or identity tokens.

## 🌐 Project Vision
To support NFTs that adapt and evolve based on user interaction, game states, achievements, or external data — giving true "dynamism" to digital ownership.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add Chainlink oracle support for dynamic, real-world data
- Enable admin- or event-driven metadata updates
- Add royalty logic and transfer functionality (with SIP-009 compliance)
- Metadata versioning and history tracking
